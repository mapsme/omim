pugixml [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zeux/pugixml.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zeux/pugixml)
=======

pugixml is a C++ XML processing library, which consists of a DOM-like interface with rich traversal/modification
capabilities, an extremely fast XML parser which constructs the DOM tree from an XML file/buffer, and an XPath 1.0
implementation for complex data-driven tree queries. Full Unicode support is also available, with Unicode interface
variants and conversions between different Unicode encodings (which happen automatically during parsing/saving).

pugixml is used by a lot of projects, both open-source and proprietary, for performance and easy-to-use interface.

## Documentation

Documentation for the current release of pugixml is available on-line as two separate documents:

* [Quick-start guide](http://cdn.rawgit.com/zeux/pugixml/v1.5/docs/quickstart.html), that aims to provide enough information to start using the library;
* [Complete reference manual](http://cdn.rawgit.com/zeux/pugixml/v1.5/docs/manual.html), that describes all features of the library in detail.

Youâ€™re advised to start with the quick-start guide; however, many important library features are either not described in it at all or only mentioned briefly; if you require more information you should read the complete manual.
