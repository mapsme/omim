# maps_generator
It's tool for generation maps for maps.me application.

Note: **Use generator_tool and application from the same release. Application does not support
maps built by generator_tool newer than app.**

##  What are maps for maps.me?
Maps for maps.me are data with special meta information for drawing, quick searching and routing and for other.
Files from [omim/data/borders](https://github.com/mapsme/omim/tree/master/data/borders) define map boundaries.
Further we will call it countries or simply maps.
But there are two special maps: World and WorldCoasts. They are used when other maps have not been downloaded.
Further we will call them world and coastlines.

## Setup
You must have Python version not lower than 3.6 and complete the following steps:

0. Switch to the branch of your app's version (see the note of #maps_generator section). 
For example, if you use MAPS.ME 9.2.3 you should do:
```sh
git checkout release-92
```
The app version can be found in the "About" section in the settings menu of MAPS.ME.
1. [Build and install generator_tool.](https://github.com/mapsme/omim/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md#maps-generator)
2. Change directory:
```sh
$ cd omim/tools/python/maps_generator
```
3. Install dependencies:
```sh
maps_generator$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Make ini file:
```sh
maps_generator$ cp var/etc/map_generator.ini.default var/etc/map_generator.ini
```

5. Edit ini file:
```sh
maps_generator$ vim var/etc/map_generator.ini
```

                        maps' are built - maps without additional data and
                        advertising.
  --order ORDER         Mwm generation order.
```

If you are not from the maps.me team, then you do not need the option --production when generating maps.

To generate maps for the whole planet you need 400 GB of hard disk space and a computer with more than 64 GB.


If you want to generate a lot of maps, then it may be important for you to order the generation of maps.
Because different maps take different amounts of time to generate.
Using a list with maps order can reduce build time on a multi-core computer.
The order from: var/etc/mwm_generation_order.txt is used by default.
You can override this behavior with the option --order=/path/to/mwm_generation_order.txt
You can calculate this list yourself from the statistics, which is calculated with each generation.

### Examples
####  Non-standard planet with coastlines
If you want to generate maps for Japan you must complete the following steps:
1. Open https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/japan.html and copy url of osm.pbf and md5sum files.
2. Edit ini file:
```sh
maps_generator$ vim var/etc/map_generator.ini
```

```ini
[Main]
...
DEBUG: 0
...
[External]
PLANET_URL: https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/japan-latest.osm.pbf
PLANET_MD5_URL: https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/japan-latest.osm.pbf.md5
...
```

3. Run
```sh
python$ python3.6 -m maps_generator --countries="World, WorldCoasts, Japan_*"
```

####  Rebuild stages:
For example, you changed routing code in omim project and want to regenerate maps.
You must have previous generation. You may regenerate from stage routing only for two mwms:

```sh
python$ python3.6 -m maps_generator -c --from_stage="Routing" --countries="Japan_Kinki Region_Osaka_Osaka, Japan_Chugoku Region_Tottori"
```
##### Note: To generate maps with the coastline, you need more time and you need the planet to contain a continuous coastline.

####  Non-standard planet without coastlines
If you want to generate maps for Moscow you must complete the following steps:
1. Open https://download.geofabrik.de/russia/central-fed-district.html and copy url of osm.pbf and md5sum files.
2. Edit ini file:
```sh
maps_generator$ vim var/etc/map_generator.ini
```

```ini
[Main]
...
DEBUG: 0
...
[External]
PLANET_URL: https://download.geofabrik.de/russia/central-fed-district-latest.osm.pbf
PLANET_MD5_URL: https://download.geofabrik.de/russia/central-fed-district-latest.osm.pbf.md5
...
```

3. Run
```sh
python$ python3.6 -m maps_generator --countries="Russia_Moscow" --skip="Coastline"
```

#### Generate all possible mwms from .osm.pbf file
If you cut some area (with http://geojson.io and osmium tool for example) and you don't want to think what mwms got into this .osm.pbf file, you just:
```sh
python$ python3.6 -m maps_generator --skip="Coastline" --without_countries="World*"
```
