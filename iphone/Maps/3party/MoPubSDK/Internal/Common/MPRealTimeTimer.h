/***
 * MPRealTimeTimer is a class meant for situations in which one may want to disaptch an event for later without
 * any regard for application state. Backgrounding and suspension will not affect time keeping. MPRealTimeTimer will NOT
 * fire while the application is backgrounded or suspended, but will fire immediately upon foregrounding if the
 * application is not foregrounded when the time interval elapses.
 *
 * Note: MPRealTimeTimer uses NSTimer as a base and as such perfect accuracy is not guaranteed.
