 The `PFRole` class represents a Role on the Parse server.
 `PFRoles` represent groupings of `PFUser` objects for the purposes of granting permissions
 (e.g. specifying a `PFACL` for a `PFObject`).
 Roles are specified by their sets of child users and child roles,
 all of which are granted any permissions that the parent role has.

 Roles must have a name (which cannot be changed after creation of the role), and must specify an ACL.
