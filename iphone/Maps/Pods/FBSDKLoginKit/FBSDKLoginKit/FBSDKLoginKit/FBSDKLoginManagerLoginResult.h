// This is an unfortunate hack for Swift Package Manager support.
// SPM does not allow us to conditionally exclude Swift files for compilation by platform.
//
// So to support tvOS with SPM we need to use runtime availability checks in the Swift files.
// This means that even though the code in `LoginManager.swift` will never be run for tvOS
// targets, it still needs to be able to compile. Hence we need to declare it here.
//
// The way to fix this is to remove extensions of ObjC types in Swift.
// This will be be done in the next major release (6.0)
