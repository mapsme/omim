#if TARGET_OS_TV

// This is an unfortunate hack for Swift Package Manager support.
// SPM does not allow us to conditionally exclude Swift files for compilation by platform.
//
// So to support tvOS with SPM we need to use runtime availability checks in the Swift files.
// This means that even though the code in `LoginManager.swift` will never be run for tvOS
// targets, it still needs to be able to compile. Hence we need to declare it here.
//
// The way to fix this is to remove extensions of ObjC types in Swift.
// This will be be done in the next major release (6.0)

 FBSDKLoginBehavior enum

 Facebook Login authorizes the application to act on behalf of the user, using the user's
 Facebook account. Usually a Facebook Login will rely on an account maintained outside of
 the application, by the native Facebook application, the browser, or perhaps the device
 itself. This avoids the need for a user to enter their username and password directly, and
 provides the most secure and lowest friction way for a user to authorize the application to
 interact with Facebook.

 The \c FBSDKLoginBehavior enum specifies which log-in methods may be used. The SDK
  will determine the best behavior based on the current device (such as iOS version).

 `FBSDKLoginManager` works directly with `[FBSDKAccessToken currentAccessToken]` and

 You should check `[FBSDKAccessToken currentAccessToken]` before calling logIn* to see if there is
 a cached token available (typically in your viewDidLoad).

 "currentAccessToken" before calling logIn* to authorize further permissions on your tokens.

 you could make that check at viewDidLoad.
