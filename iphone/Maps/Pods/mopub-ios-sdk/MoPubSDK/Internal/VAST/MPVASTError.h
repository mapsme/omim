/**
 `MPVASTError` enums are the error codes defined in VAST specification. See the VAST specifications
 at https://iabtechlab.com/standards/vast/.

 The current version of `MPVASTError` adopts VAST version 4.2 error codes as defined in section
 "2.3.6.3 VAST Error Codes Table". VAST error codes are designed to be backward compatible, which
 means this set of error codes is a superset of previous versions of them.

 Note: Only a portion of these error codes are implemented in the MoPub SDK, as some of the error codes
 are deprecated, not applicable, or being too vague for the meaning. Unused error codes should be
 commented out and kept for reference.

 Per VAST spec, at a minimum, error code 900 `MPVASTErrorUndefined` can be used, but a more specific
 error code benefits all parties involved.
