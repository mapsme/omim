/**
 * The MoPub iOS SDK mediates third party Ad Networks using custom events.  The custom events are
 * responsible for instantiating and manipulating objects in the third party SDK and translating
 * and communicating events from those objects back to the MoPub SDK by notifying a delegate.
 *
 * `MPBannerCustomEvent` is a base class for custom events that support banners. By implementing
 * subclasses of `MPBannerCustomEvent` you can enable the MoPub SDK to natively support a wide
 * variety of third-party ad networks.
 *
 * At runtime, the MoPub SDK will find and instantiate an `MPBannerCustomEvent` subclass as needed and
 * invoke its `-requestAdWithSize:customEventInfo:` method.
