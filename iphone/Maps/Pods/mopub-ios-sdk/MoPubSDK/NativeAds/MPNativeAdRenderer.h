 * Your renderer should implement this protocol. Your renderer is responsible for rendering the network's ad data into a view
 * when `-retrieveViewWithAdapter:error:` is called. Your renderer will be asked to render the native ad if your renderer configuration
 * indicates that your renderer supports your specific native ad network.
 *
 * Finally, your renderer will live as long as the ad adapter so you may store data in your renderer if necessary.
