/**
 * The `MPClientAdPositioning` class is a model that allows you to control the positions where
 * native advertisements should appear within a stream. A positioning object works in conjunction
 * with an ad placer, giving the ad placer the information it needs to configure the positions and
 * frequency of ads. You can specify that ads should appear at fixed index paths and/or at equally
 * spaced intervals throughout your content.
 *
 * Unlike with `MPServerAdPositioning`, which tells an ad placer to obtain its positioning
 * information from the MoPub ad server, client ad positioning does not allow you to control your ad
 * positions via the MoPub website.
