# mopub-ios-mediation

We have formally separated network adapters from our MoPub SDK repository to enable an independent release cadence resulting in faster certification cycles. 

We have also added a new tool to make it easier for publishers to get up and running with mediation integration. Check it out [here](https://developers.mopub.com/docs/mediation/integrate/).
