# MAPS.ME

[MAPS.ME](http://maps.me) is an open source cross-platform offline maps application,
built on top of crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap data. It was publicly released
for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id510623322) and
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro).

## Translations

If you want to improve app translations or add more search synonyms, please check our [wiki](https://github.com/mapsme/omim/wiki).

## Compilation

To compile the project, you would need to initialize private key files. Run
`configure.sh` and press Enter to create empty files, good enough to build desktop
and Android debug packages.

For detailed installation instructions and Android/iOS building process,
see [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/mapsme/omim/tree/master/docs/INSTALL.md).

Nightly builds for Android are published to [osmz.ru](http://osmz.ru/mwm/)
and Dropbox: [release](http://maps.me/release), [debug](http://maps.me/debug).

## Building maps

To create one or many map files, first build the project, then use `generate_mwm.sh` script from
`tools/unix` to create a single mwm file from pbf/o5m/bz2 source, or `generate_planet.sh`
to generate multiple countries at once from a planet o5m file. See detailed instructions
in [MAPS.md](https://github.com/mapsme/omim/tree/master/docs/MAPS.md).

## Map styles

MAPS.ME uses its own binary format for map styles, `drules_proto.bin`, which is compiled from
[MapCSS](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MapCSS) using modified Kothic library.
Feature set in MWM files depends on a compiled style, so make sure to rebuild maps after
releasing a style.

For development, use MAPS.ME Designer app along with its generator tool: these allow
for quick rebuilding of a style and symbols, and for producing a zoom-independent
feature set in MWM files.

See [STYLES.md](https://github.com/mapsme/omim/tree/master/docs/STYLES.md) for the
format description, instructions on building a style and some links.

## Development

You would need Qt 5 for development, most other libraries are included into the
repository: see `3party` directory. The team uses mostly XCode and Qt Creator,
though these are not mandatory. We have an established
[coding style](https://github.com/mapsme/omim/blob/master/docs/CPP_STYLE.md).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mapsme/omim/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for the repository initialization process, the description of all the directories
of this repository and other development-related information.

All contributors must sign a [Contributor Agreement](https://github.com/mapsme/omim/blob/master/docs/CLA.md),
